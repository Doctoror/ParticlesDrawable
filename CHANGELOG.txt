v 2.0.0
- Added OpenGL module
- Renamed makeBrandNewFrameWithPointsOffscreen() to makeBrandNewFrameWithParticlesOffscreen()

v 1.0.7
- Moved nextFrame(), makeBrandNewFrame() and makeBrandNewFrameWithPointsOffscreen() to ParticlesScene interface
- Moved engine logic to SceneController

v 1.0.6

v 1.0.5
- Refactored
- Added more tests
- ParticlesDrawable and ParticlesView now implement ParticlesSceneConfiguration to make sure all configuration getters and setters are exposed

v 1.0.3
ParticlesDrawable:

- Added "makeBrandNewFrameWithPointsOffscreen" method that will place all particles offscreen so that when started, all points will float onto screen

v 1.0.2
ParticlesDrawable:
- Fixed "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: n must be positive" when radius range values round up to the same int

v 1.0.1
ParticlesDrawable:
- Fixed IllegalArgumentException when set bounds resulted in width, height or both set to zero
- Added makeBrandNewFrame() method which resets all positions and makes a random new frame. Is useful if you are using ParticlesDrawable as static, not animating backgounrd.
